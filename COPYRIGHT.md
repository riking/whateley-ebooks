## Typos.yml

The file `typos.yml` has a complicated copyright situation.

The file typos.yml is a derivative work based on The Stories. I am not a
lawyer and I have not studied US copyright law.  However, it appears
reasonable to me to assume that the usage of short snippets of text, used
only for identification, cannot supplant the usefulness of the original works
and is a small portion of the copyrighted work, and is therefore likely to be
considered Fair Use (and therefore not subject to any license restrictions).

The file typos.yml also contains original creative work from the people who
wrote the entires in the file. These contributions are copyrighted to their
authors.

The original creative work present in `typos.yml`, if any, is licensed under
a dual license.
