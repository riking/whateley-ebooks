## The Stories

The Code accesses The Stories by downloading them from The Crystal Hall via the internet. The Stories are protected by copyright law to the extent specified in The Story License.

## The Code

All parts of The Code are the copyright of their respective author. Unless indicated otherwise in the code or at the bottom of this file, all of The Code is Copyright © Kane York.

The original creative work present in The Code is licensed under multiple licenses.

 - The Code is licensed to the public under the BSD 2-clause license (the "FreeBSD License") contained in the file `LICENSE-CODE.txt`.
 - The Code is also available to Present And Future Canon Authors under the license detailed in The Crystal Hall Terms Of Use.
  - The creative work contained in The Code is necessarily sometimes copied into The Artifacts. An implicit copyright license defined by this paragraph is granted to you to use the work in The Code copied into The Artifacts to the same extent as if the work in The Code was not included in The Artifacts. (Segments of The Code not copied into The Artifacts are not covered by this grant.)

**ATTN contributors:** Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file distributed with this file for restrictions on contributing to this repository, which include agreeing to the license release above.

## Typos.yml

The file `typos.yml` has a complicated copyright situation.

Warning - the following paragraph is speculation. I am not a lawyer and I have not studied US copyright law. The following paragraph is my opinion based on my personal understanding of the current precedent. The law may be different in your country. READ THE "DISCLAIMER" AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE.

> The file typos.yml appears to me to be a derivative work based on The Stories, as it includes short snippets of text from The Stories. It appears reasonable to me to conclude that the usage of short snippets of text, used for identification of larger passages, is (1) a small amount and not substantial; (2) has little impact on the "potential market" for The Stories, and (3) has a purpose and character favorable to a finding of Fair Use of The Stories under US copyright law (and therefore not subject to any copyright license restrictions).

The file typos.yml also contains original creative work from the people who wrote the entries in the file. These contributions are the copyright of their authors.

The original creative work present in `typos.yml`, if any, is licensed under
a dual license.

 - The typos.yml file is available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) contained in the file `LICENSE-TYPOS.txt`
 - The typos.yml is also available to Present And Future Canon Authors under the license detailed in The Crystal Hall Terms Of Use.
 - The creative work contained in typos.yml is necessarily sometimes copied into The Artifacts. An implicit copyright license defined by this paragraph is granted to you to use the work in typos.yml copied into The Artifacts to the same extent as if the work in typos.yml was not included in The Artifacts. (Segments of typos.yml not copied into The Artifacts are not covered by this grant.)

**ATTN contributors:** Please see the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file distributed with this file for restrictions on contributing to this repository, which include agreeing to the license release above.

## Artifacts

Running this code creates artifacts on your computer that are materially similar derivative works of The Stories ("The Artifacts"). This means that everything in The Story License applies to The Artifacts.

(Aside: When a copyrighted tool is used to produce a creative result, the creator retains all copyright on the result and the copyright of the tool does not transfer to or "infect" the result. Therefore, The Artifacts are not affected by the BSD 2-Clause license that The Code is released under.)

This means:

 - do NOT distribute The Artifacts to other people
 - do NOT perform The Artifacts publicly
 - do NOT display The Artifacts publicly

except where permitted by The Story License (including applicable law).

In particular, this means that format changes you create of The Stories cannot be shared with anyone else.
