**Please read the [COPYRIGHT.md](./COPYRIGHT.md) file as it contains important information.** Do not share the book files this program generates. You can only create them yourself by running the code.

## Usage

     go get github.com/riking/whateley-ebooks/cmd/make-ebook
	 # Choose a folder to use
	 cd ~/Desktop/whateley-ebooks
	 mkdir book-definitions target
	 # Place book definition YML files into book-definitions/
	 # For example, using whisper.yml
	 make-ebook whisper
	 # Produces file in target/whisper.epub

Do not distribute the output files, they are for your own personal use only. If someone else wants the epub file, you can help them to run the program themselves.
