      <h3>A Whateley Academy Story</h3>
      <h1>Tennyo Goes To Hell</h1>
      <h4><em>or, "Good morning, and welcome to the lake of fire"</em></h4>
      <h3>by Babs Yerunkle</h3>
      <hr/>
      <div style="background-color: #bd362f; padding: 0.25in; ">
        <h3>Warning</h3>
        <p>This horror story contains sexual violence, physical violence, and horror.</p>
        <p>For those that wish to skip that, you may jump to the end of chapter two.</p>
        <p>Use the "Table Of Contents" selector in your ebook reader and jump to "Tennyo Goes To Hell - Epilog".</p>
      </div>
      <p>This story is darker and bloodier than anything you have ever seen in Whateley canon. In fact, it is darker and more violent than anything you have ever seen in Whateley non-canon, including April Fools' Day stories and fanfic. It contains graphic scenes of violence, rape, sexual violence, bestiality, violence, brutality, violence, raw sexuality, horror, cannibalism, violence, and insanity. Did I mention the violence yet? Okay. This is somewhere around FR21. You have been warned.
      </p>
      <p>That said, this is a great story by a beloved Whateley author, even if some will find it very disturbing. It is not necessary to read it, because all key events will be covered elsewhere. But if you're interested (and in my personal opinion it is well worth reading). Continue reading only if you understand and can legally make the decision to subject yourself to this type of story. If you are under age or experience PTSD/trigger events due to the above things, we recommend you skip this content.
